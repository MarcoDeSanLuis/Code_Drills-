# Code_Drills-
Daily Coding Practice
Random Walk: The files random_walk.rb and random_walk.py are my variations of the random_walk exercise which incorporate Object Oriented Programming. I have them memorized and practice them regularly in order to keep the fundamental concepts fresh in my brain and quick on my fingertips. The customers have bank accounts set up and take a random walk. Depending upon how far their trip takes them, they either walk back or return via taxi. If they return via taxi, the fare is calculated based upon the distance they ride. After each random walk they take, their bank account is debited and their taxi expenses increase accordingly. I've thought about adding some more activities for my walkers such as shopping if certain distances are reached. Whatever is added, I'd like it to be something that sharpens my programming skills as these ARE drills. Anna, I'd love to have a Java version.
